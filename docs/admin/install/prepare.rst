Apply BIOS updates and check settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before beginning the Qubes installation, make sure that your Qubes-compatible computer's BIOS is updated to the latest available version. If you're using one of the recommended ThinkPad T-series models, see the section on :ref:`thinkpad_t_series`. The process will be different for other makes and models, and can usually be found on their respective support sites.

Once the BIOS is up-to-date, boot into the BIOS setup utility and update its settings. Note that not all BIOS versions will support the items listed, but if available following changes are recommended:

- Ensure the internal clock is correct.
- Set a password to access the BIOS (and record the password in your password manager).
- Disable BIOS downgrades.
- Enable Data Execution Prevention.
- Enable virtualization support (required for Qubes OS).
  - for Intel-based devices, **Intel VT-d** and **Intel VT-x** should be enabled
  - for AMD-based devices, **AMD-VI** and **AMD-V** should be enabled
- Disable unnecessary I/O options such as Wireless WAN and  Bluetooth.
- Disable unnecessary network options such as Wake-on-LAN and UEFI network stacks.
- Disable Thunderbolt ports, or any other ports that allow Direct Memory Access (DMA).
- Enable any physical tamper detection options.
- Disable Computrace.
- Disable SecureBoot.

If the Qubes hardware compatibility list entry for your computer recommends the use of Legacy Mode for boot, change that setting in the BIOS as well.

Download and verify Qubes OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the working computer, download the Qubes OS ISO and cryptographic hash values for version ``4.2.2`` from `https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/ <https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/#qubes-release-4-2-2>`_. The ISO is 6.9 GB approximately, and may take some time to download based on the speed of your Internet connection.

Follow the linked instructions to `verify the ISO <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/verifying-signatures/#how-to-verify-detached-pgp-signatures-on-qubes-isos>`_. Ensure that the ISO and hash values are in the same directory, then run:

.. code-block:: sh

  gpg --keyserver-options no-self-sigs-only,no-import-clean --fetch-keys https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-release-4.2-signing-key.asc
  gpg -v --verify Qubes-R4.2.2-x86_64.iso.DIGESTS
  
The output should look like this:

.. code-block:: sh
 
  gpg: requesting key from 'https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-release-4.2-signing-key.asc'
  gpg: key E022E58F8E34D89F: public key "Qubes OS Release 4.2 Signing Key" imported
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1
  gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found

  gpg: armor header: Hash: SHA256
  gpg: original file name=''
  gpg: Signature made Tue 25 Jun 2024 01:32:23 PM EDT
  gpg:                using RSA key 9C884DF3F81064A569A4A9FAE022E58F8E34D89F
  gpg: using pgp trust model
  gpg: Good signature from "Qubes OS Release 4.2 Signing Key" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 9C88 4DF3 F810 64A5 69A4  A9FA E022 E58F 8E34 D89F
  gpg: textmode signature, digest algorithm SHA256, key algorithm rsa4096
  
Specifically, you will want to make sure that you see "Good signature" listed in the text. If it does not report a good signature, try deleting the ISO and downloading it again.

Once you've verified the ISO, copy it to your installation medium - for example, if using Linux and a USB stick, using the command:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo dd if=Qubes-R4.2.2-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1048576 && sync

where ``if`` is set to the path to your downloaded ISO file and ``of`` is set to
the block device corresponding to your USB stick. Note that any data on the USB stick will be overwritten.

.. caution:: Make sure to verify that you have the correct device name using, for example, the ``lsblk`` command. You should write to the full device (eg. ``/dev/sdc``) rather than to a partition (eg. ``/dev/sdc1``).


Install Qubes OS (estimated wait time: 30-45 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the installation, please ensure that:
  - the computer is charging
  - all USB devices like YubiKeys, mice and keyboards are disconnected

To begin the Qubes installation, connect the Qubes install USB to your target computer and boot from it. You may need to bring up a boot menu at startup to do so - on Lenovo laptops, for example, you can do so by pressing **F12** on boot.

Follow the `installation documentation <https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/installation-guide/>`_ to install Qubes on your computer, ensuring that you:

- Use English - United States as the setup language. (This requirement will be dropped in a future version).
- Use all available storage space for the installation (as the computer should be dedicated to SecureDrop Workstation).
- Set a strong full disk encryption (FDE) passphrase - a 6-word Diceware passphrase is recommended.
- Create an administrative account named ``user`` with a strong password.

.. note:: Qubes is not intended to have multiple user accounts, so your account name and password will be shared by all SecureDrop Workstation users. The password will be required to log in and unlock the screen during sessions - choosing something strong but memorable and easily typed is recommended!

Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to reboot into Qubes. Reboot, removing the install USB when the computer restarts.

You will be prompted to enter the FDE passphrase set during installation.

After the disk is unlocked and Qubes starts, you will be prompted to complete the initial setup. Click the Qubes OS icon.

On the configuration screen, ensure that the following options are checked:

 - Default Template should be set to "Fedora 40 Xfce"
 - "Create default system qubes (sys-net, sys-firewall, default DispVM)"
 - "Make sys-firewall and sys-usb disposable"

If there is a grayed out option "USB qube configuration disabled", make a note of this. An additional setup step will be required (see next section).

Finally, click **Finish Configuration** to set up the default system TemplateVMs and AppVMs.

Once the initial setup is complete, the login dialog will be displayed. Log in using the username and password set during installation.

(Hardware-dependent) Apply USB fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If, during the installation, you encountered the grayed out option "USB qube configuration disabled", you must now create a VM to access your USB devices. If you did not encounter this issue, you can skip this section.

To create a USB qube, open a ``dom0`` terminal by opening the **Q Menu**, selecting the gear icon on the left-hand side, then selecting **Other > Xfce Terminal**

.. tip::

  For quicker access, you can add the ``dom0`` terminal to the "Favorites" section of the
  Qubes menu (identified by a bookmark symbol). Right-click the entry and select
  **Add to favorites**. To remove it at a later time, right-click the entry in your
  list of favorites and select **Remove from favorites**.

Run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo qubesctl state.sls qvm.sys-usb

After the command exits, confirm that you see an entry "Service: sys-usb" in the Qubes menu. If ``sys-usb`` is not running, you can start it with the command ``qvm-start sys-usb`` in ``dom0``. Once ``sys-usb`` is running, click the devices widget in the upper right panel to expand a listing of all devices detected by Qubes OS.

Now, insert a safe USB device you intend to use with the SecureDrop Workstation. Click the devices widget again. Does the newly attached USB device appear in the list? If so, USB support is working and you can proceed with the installation. If you do encounter the error message "Denied qubes.InputKeyboard from sys-usb to dom0", you need to additionally enable USB keyboard support:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo qubesctl state.sls qvm.usb-keyboard

While we recommend against the use of a USB keyboard for security reasons, this error can also occur in combination with other USB devices on some hardware.

.. _apply_dom0_updates:

Apply ``dom0`` updates (estimated wait time: 15-30 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``dom0`` is the most trusted domain on Qubes OS, and has privileged access to all other VMs. As such, it is important to ensure that all available security updates have been applied to ``dom0`` as the first step after the installation.

After logging in, use the network manager widget in the upper-right panel to configure your network connection.

Open a ``dom0`` terminal by opening the **Q Menu**, selecting the gear icon on the left-hand side, then selecting **Other > Xfce Terminal**. Run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo qubes-dom0-update -y

Wait for all updates to complete. If you encounter an error during this stage, please contact us for assistance, as it may not be safe to proceed with the installation.

After updating ``dom0``, reboot the workstation to ensure that all updates have taken effect for your active session.

Apply updates to system templates (estimated wait time: 45-60 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After logging in again, confirm that the network manager successfully connects you to the configured network. If necessary, verify the network settings using the network manager widget.

- Next, configure Tor by selecting the Qubes menu (the **Q** icon in the upper left corner) and selecting **Q > Service > sys-whonix > Anon Connection Wizard**. In most cases, choosing the default **Connect** option is best. Click **Next**, then **Next** again. Then, if Tor connects successfully, click **Finish**. If Tor fails to connect, make sure your network conection is up and does not filter Tor connections, then try again.

  .. note:: If Tor connections are blocked on your network, you may need to configure Tor to use bridges in order to get a connection. For more information, see the `Anon Connection Wizard <https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard>`_ documentation.

- Once Tor has connected, select the **Q Menu**, click the gear icon on the left-hand side, then select **Qubes Tools > Qubes Update** to update the system VMs. in the ``[Dom0] Qubes Update`` window, check all entries in the list above except for ``dom0`` (which you have already updated in the previous step). Then, click **Update**. The system's VMs will be updated sequentially - this may take some time. When the updates are complete, click **Next**. You will then be prompted to **Finish and restart/shutdown 4 qubes.** Go ahead and do so, and allow time for them to restart.
