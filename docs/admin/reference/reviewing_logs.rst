Reviewing and exporting logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SecureDrop Workstation aggregates system logs from all its VMs in the ``sd-log`` VM, in the folder ``~/QubesIncomingLogs``, with one subfolder for each VM. You can inspect these logs directly in the ``sd-log`` VM, or you can copy them to another VM, e.g., for purposes of sharing logs with the SecureDrop development team.

You can open the logs folder by running the following in a dom0 terminal: ``qvm-run sd-log nautilus ~/QubesIncomingLogs``.

Please note that while the logs do not include original filenames or message contents, they do contain sensitive information, e.g.:

- timing and usage information related to SecureDrop access
- the two-word designation for a given source
- metadata about submissions and replies
- error messages that disclose further details

For this reason, the ``sd-log`` VM is networkless, and you cannot copy files from ``sd-log`` to other VMs by default.

If you want to selectively enable copying logs to a single VM, you can use tags, similar to the method used for :doc:`managing clipboard access <managing_clipboard>`. You can add and remove the permission just before each copying operation; the change will take effect immediately.

.. important::

   Before copying logs to a networked VM, inspect them for sensitive information, and redact them as warranted.

To enable copying logs to a target VM, you can use a command like the following in ``dom0``, substituting ``<VM name>`` with the name of the target VM (e.g., ``work``):

.. code-block:: sh

   qvm-tags <VM name> add sd-receive-logs

Verify that the tag was successfully applied using the ``ls`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: sh

   qvm-tags <VM name> ls

To remove the permission, use this command in ``dom0``:

.. code-block:: sh

   qvm-tags <VM name> del sd-receive-logs

With the permission in effect, you can use the command ``qvm-copy`` in a terminal in ``sd-log`` to copy individual files to the target VM. For example, to copy a file ``syslog-redacted.log``, you would use this command:

.. code-block:: sh

   qvm-copy syslog-redacted.log

A graphical prompt will permit you to select any target VM that has the ``sd-receive-logs`` tag. Once successfully copied, the file can be found in the directory ``~/QubesIncoming/sd-log`` in the target VM. See the `Qubes OS documentation on copying files <https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/copying-files/>`__ for more information.

To review current copy permissions, you can use ``qvm-ls`` to print out a list of VMs that can receive files from ``sd-log``:

.. code-block:: sh

   qvm-ls --tags sd-receive-logs
