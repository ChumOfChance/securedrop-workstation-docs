How does SecureDrop Workstation work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SecureDrop Workstation is a Qubes-based project. It consists of several
different carefully-configured virtual machines (VMs), so that everything a
journalist needs to use SecureDrop resides on one computer. Encryption and
decryption happen with one click using a network-isolated VM that holds the
SecureDrop Submission Key. Submissions can be viewed securely on the same
machine thanks to a `feature of Qubes`_ that creates temporary VMs in
which to view untrusted content without exposing the rest of your system to
that content.

As a journalist, you will log into the SecureDrop application with the
same credentials you previously used to log into the Journalist Interface. You
will then be able to view, download, and reply to and submissions---all on the
same device.

How is using Qubes different from using virtual machines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual machines that run on your Mac, Windows, or Linux machine (such as those
created using VirtualBox, Parallels, and so on) are a "guest" on your machine,
but still require a "host" operating system on top of which to run. These virtual machines are not designed as security tools; if the host OS is
compromised, there are no protections for the guest OS, and some features (such
as networking) allow communications between guest and host that can compromise
the security of both.

In contrast, Qubes virtualization occurs at a lower level, under the `Xen
hypervisor`_. This means that virtual machines (VMs) in a Qubes environment
can run operating systems that are independent of each
other and are not reliant on a host OS.

In addition, these virtual machines can be used to quarantine specific
functions of your computer. For example, network access is provided via two or
more VMs, and you can control which applications or files
have access to a networked environment by connecting to or disconnecting from
these VMs.

Finally, Qubes is designed to make it more difficult for malware to remain on
your machine. Each VM has read-only access to the root filesystem that
provides its operating system, meaning that if a VM is infected
with malware, it will be more difficult for that malware to persist across a
reboot of that VM.

For more about the security features of Qubes, see
`the Qubes OS documentation`_.

How does the security of this system compare to using an air-gapped Secure Viewing Station?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The air-gapped Secure Viewing Station that is part of a SecureDrop setup offers strong
protections against exfiltration of submissions or encryption keys by adversaries. It lacks
important protections that SecureDrop Workstation provides. On the other hand, vulnerabilities
in Qubes OS or Xen Hypervisor may have a greater security impact than vulnerabilities
in Tails, the operating system used on a Secure Viewing Station.

A typical SVS USB drive may contain documents from multiple sources and always
contains the highly sensitive private key needed to decrypt them. An adversary who does
manage to achieve a security compromise (e.g., through a vulnerability in a file viewer
application) can access these other files, and may be able to exfiltrate them.

In spite of the air-gap, this may be possible through physical channels used to transfer files
off the SVS (e.g., USB drives), or by motivating the journalist user to perform an
unsafe action (e.g., `scanning a QR code <https://securedrop.org/news/security-advisory-do-not-scan-qr-codes-submitted-through-securedrop-connected-devices/>`__).

Because the air-gapped SVS has no Internet access, updates can only be performed using
another computer and a USB drive. In practice, newsrooms may not update their SVS
in a timely manner, which can significantly worsen its security posture.

In SecureDrop Workstation, any document received via SecureDrop is opened in a
disposable VM that has no Internet access and no access to other files submitted
via SecureDrop. The encryption keys are stored in a separate, networkless VM
from the SecureDrop Client app.

Because SecureDrop Workstation has Internet access, updates can be applied
automatically as soon as they are available. SecureDrop Workstation enforces this
by downloading and applying updates before the user logs into SecureDrop.

SecureDrop Workstation uses hardware-assisted virtualization, which allows us
to use custom kernels for its VMs. These custom kernels use the
`grsecurity <https://grsecurity.net/>`__ patches which are also used on the
SecureDrop servers, and provide additional mitigation against security
vulnerabilities.

An attacker able to exploit vulnerabilities in Qubes OS or Xen-based bare metal
virtualization (likely in combination with other vulnerabilities, e.g., in a
viewer application) may be able to exfiltrate information directly to the Internet.
Qubes closely `tracks <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/xsa/>`__ any security
vulnerabilities that may impact it, and the automatic update mechanism helps to
ensure that, in the event of a vulnerability, every SecureDrop Workstation can be
patched as quickly as possible.

For further technical detail on design rationale and mitigations, please consult
our `design document <https://securedrop.org/whitepaper.pdf>`__.

Can I install custom software on SecureDrop Workstation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right now, the pilot project is designed to make the journalist experience
easier by combining the functionality of the Journalist Workstation and Secure
Viewing Station. The main focus is making sure that checking SecureDrop is
easier and faster.

While we hope to add advanced tooling and document-processing options down the line,
at this time we request that you do not change the configuration of the workstation
or install additional software on it. If you have specific needs that you would like
to discuss with us, please open an issue `in our support portal`_ or send us a
`GPG-encrypted email`_ at support@freedom.press.

Why canâ€™t I save or print from the Viewer VM apps?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you view a file on SecureDrop Workstation, it is opened in a disposable
VM that cannot access the network or any peripherals. The VM and all its data
will be destroyed the moment you close the viewer application.

You can save files from a viewer application, but copies saved inside a disposable
VM will be deleted when you close the application, and the changes will not be applied
to the main copy of the file stored on your computer.

You cannot print from the viewer application, because it does not have access
to peripherals. This prevents malware from exfiltrating data (e.g., via attached
USB devices), and from targeting hardware-level security vulnerabilities.

You *can* print files directly from the SecureDrop Client by clicking "Print"
for a downloaded file, which will pass the file through to your USB printer
without opening it in an interactive viewer application.

Why can't I copy and paste?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should be able to copy and paste *within* any VM on the system, e.g.,
from one application running in ``sd-app`` to another.

Copy and paste between and to SecureDrop Workstation VMs is disabled for security
reasons. The goal of this restriction is to minimize the risk of accidental
pastes of sensitive content, and to reduce the attack surface for attempts to
exfiltrate information.

Administrators can configure limited exceptions to this policy; please see the
section :doc:`Managing Clipboard Access <../admin/reference/managing_clipboard>`
of the admin guide for more information.

Why does it take so long to start the SecureDrop Client?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the system has not been updated recently, the preflight updater will check
for available security updates for all VMs used by SecureDrop Workstation,
download, and apply them. This takes longer than for typical operating systems
because of the number of VMs involved, and because some updates are performed
over the Tor network.

These updates are essential to keep SecureDrop Workstation secure. Their speed
is expected to be improved in subsequent releases of SecureDrop Workstation.
