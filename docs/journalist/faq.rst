Can I install custom software on SecureDrop Workstation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right now, the pilot project is designed to make the journalist experience
easier by combining the functionality of the Journalist Workstation and Secure
Viewing Station. The main focus is making sure that checking SecureDrop is
easier and faster. While we hope to add advanced tooling and document-
processing options down the line, at this time we request that you leave the
workstation configured the way it was provisioned, and hold off on installing
additional software or changing the functionality or configuration of any of
the VMs. If you have specific needs that you'd like to discuss with us, open an
issue `in our support portal`_ or send us a `GPG-encrypted email`_ at
support@freedom.press.
