When turning on the SecureDrop Workstation computer, you will be greeted with a
password prompt. This is the full-disk encryption passphrase.

This passphrase protects your entire system. It is of the utmost importance to
secure this passphrase. When not using the SecureDrop Workstation, shut it down
completely so as to take advantage of the protections offered by full-disk
encryption.

After entering the passphrase, Qubes OS will boot. Log in with the username and
password set up by your administrator.
